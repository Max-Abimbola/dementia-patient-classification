Patients records from longitudinal MRI data from the Open Access Series of
Imaging Studies focusing on dementia/Alzheimer's disease [1].

The datasets includes records of up to 4 annual visits for 150 participants.
At each visit T1-weighted MRI scans of the brain have been obtained and the
status (disease diagnosis) of each patient have been evaluated (it can change
between the visits).

Research questions:
- is it possible to distinguish healthy patients records from cases of dementia? (YES)
- what are the characteristics of patients with different dementia rating?
- which patients get worse over time? how fast? by how much?
- can we predict the conversion to demented status after the first visit?
- which attributes are the most predictive and which are useless?
- does change observed after 1 year predict demented status in year 2 or later?

Attribute description:
- patient ID
- MRI exam ID
- visit
- age
- sex: M/F
- hand: R/L
- delay: MR delay time (contrast)
- YOE: years of education
- SES: socioeconomic status (5 categories)
- MMSE: Mini Mental State Examination (0-30 points)
- CDR: Clinical Dementia Rating (none, very mild, mild, moderate, severe)
- eTIV: estimated Total Intracranial Volume
- nWBV: normalised Whole Brain Volume
- ASF: Atlas Scaling Factor

*) The original dataset has been altered for educational purposes




- Progression instead of a piechart to show competency
- Show all 18 AHEP 4 outcomes instead of groupings
- SDGs are actually UNSECO competencies
- 17 SDGs need to be there and inputted directly (works as pie chart)
- Need to meet every ahep 4 outcome
	- Need to meet every ahep 4 outcome 3 times
- Add icons in the create events page
- Make create events page a full page


Report
- 1st page summary of ahep 4 outcomes they've met and unesco competencies and SDG pie charts
- More customisation on what report
- really likes date range for report
- Favourite button for events so events can be included in the report
